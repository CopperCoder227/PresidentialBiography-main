        <p>
          Taft attended Yale University, from which he graduated second in his
          class in 1878. Becoming a lawyer was a natural step for Taft, and he
          studied at the Cincinnati Law School where he graduated with the class
          of 1880. Admitted to the bar in Ohio, he combined politics with his
          practice.
          <br />
          Yes, William Howard Taft had several notable early career experiences
          before entering politics, including: Assistant prosecutor: In 1881,
          Taft became an assistant prosecutor in Hamilton County, Ohio, due to
          his father's political connections Judge of the Cincinnati Superior
          Court: In 1887, Taft was appointed judge of the Cincinnati Superior
          Court U.S. solicitor general: In 1890, Taft was appointed U.S.
          solicitor general, the third highest position in the Department of
          Justice Judge of the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals: In 1892,
          Taft was appointed judge of the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
          Civilian governor of the Philippines: In 1901, President William
          McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines Secretary
          of War: In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Taft Secretary
          of War
          <br />
          Taft obtains an injunction to prevent western railroads from raising
          freight rates. Taft was a fervent anti-trust supporter whose
          unrelenting anti-trust crusade outmatched even that of Teddy
          Roosevelt.
